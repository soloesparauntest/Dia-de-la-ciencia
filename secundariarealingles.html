<p id = "textolargo">A journey through the fantastic world of video games.<br/><br/>


  The games with video or more commonly referred to as video games are software or applications implemented in electronic devices for educational and entertainment purposes. They arise around the 50s and although it is not known with certainty which was the first video game is considered that the Nought and crosses colloquially called "triki" could be presented as one of the first, the latter was developed by Alexander Douglas in 1952 and was presented in a computerized version that only allowed one person to interact with the machine.<br/><br/>
  Otherwise the video game boom took place around the 1970s due to the implementation of new devices other than the computer such as the Pong and Atari recreational machine, its success was growing and also generated a lot of industries dedicated to this video game production.<br/><br/>
  Already in the 1980s there was a shocking growth of this sector, because the popularity of recreational machines and the first video consoles made these halls become a place of entertainment and meeting for young people especially. At this time, games such as Pacman, Battle Zone, Pole Position, Tron and Saxxon became famous. However, the Americans went through a video game crisis (1983-1985) giving way to Japan betting on console machines, succeeding with the Famicom in 1983, released by Nintendo. After this crisis, the United States again entered the competition, and between these two countries the development of video games continued.<br/><br/>
  In the meantime, Super Mario Bros., the world-famous video game was created in 1985 by Nintendo. Not only is it a great classic, but it was also a turning point in the world of games, as it manages to break with the monotony and system of the games of that time, which had few repetitive screens generating an endless loop. In this way he was the most creative of his time, having a goal and an end in him.<br/><br/>
  By the end of the 80’s the 16-bit machines appear that means that, in these the image already begins to have more complexity and quality while you have more capacity to add many more color shades; like Sega’s Mega Drive. In addition, previously used microcomputers are replaced by personal computers designed according to the architecture of IBM (International Business Machines Corporation).<br/><br/>
  Then, in the field of the arcade games appear like Defender, Rally-x, Dig Dug, Bubble Bobble, among others; which have different nationalities, with Japan being the largest producer.<br/><br/>
  From then on, video games were technologically improved by increasing the degree of complexity by adding microprocessors, chips and devices that generated greater performance until achieving the revolution of graphic formats (1990-1999) through two-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces provided by renowned companies (Nintendo-Sony-Sega-Neo Geo).<br/><br/>
  Likewise, its influence in social and cultural areas grew, as the meetings between young people were in these halls full of recreational machines, becoming an icon of culture and a further choice of our entertainment. The path in the development of this sector has found several heavy stones of criticism regarding whether or not it contributes to a personal and psychosocial development in the human being. Several scientists have been concerned to study whether these are harmful to those who consume them, or whether they receive benefits and opportunities.<br/><br/>
  These investigations give valid arguments, from which it is possible to show, on the one hand, how harmful it can be in the meantime: it creates a rejection of reality, because it becomes easier to deal with the obstacles that are proposed in a game evading the social problems of an ordinary life. It also generates addiction and stress, since the time in which it is played can be too long, affecting hours of sleep, little tolerance to lose, loss of appetite, among other factors that can put in risk the physical and mental health. Another important element (not only by the scientific community but by society in general) is the incentive to violence; well, most games are about the dichotomy between good and evil, placing the player on one of these sides and the images are very explicit, affecting the viewer’s sensitivity. Being the greatest concern, that these may come to present cases of imitation (which has already happened), as has happened in the film industry.<br/><br/>
  On the other hand, there are many studies that show that video games can be beneficial, because it develops in the player multiple skills that with practice become interesting capabilities for the development of the player in everyday life; for example, decision-making, creating in it the value of responsibility, the knowledge of recognizing that any action has irreversible consequences. It also becomes educational, as many speak about important historical facts or different languages, which is often a space for self-learning. It is also important that they develop motor and visual skills, foster mental development as they encounter puzzles or unknowns that need to be resolved to advance in the game.<br/><br/>
  To conclude, it can be argued that video games, as in any industry, are not subject to generalization, since the impact of these depends on the personality and age of the players, therefore there must be commitment on the part of the industry in the classification of these games; On the other hand, there is also a responsibility on the part of the parents to allow the child to play, as well as to show whether or not it affects the child’s physical and mental health. In any case, like any technological project, it will move forward with time and we are sure to have great things to see in this field.<br/><br/>
